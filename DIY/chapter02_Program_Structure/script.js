// PROGRAM STRUCTURE

// 1. EXPRESSIONS AND STATEMENTS
// A fragment of code that produces a value is called an expression.
// Every value that is written literally (such as 22 or "psychoanalysis") is an expression.
// An expression between parentheses is also an expression, as is a binary operator applied to
// two expressions or a unary operator aplied to one.

// If an expression corresponds to a sentence fragment, a Javascript statement corresponds to
// a full sentence. A program is a list of statements.

// 2. BINDINGS
