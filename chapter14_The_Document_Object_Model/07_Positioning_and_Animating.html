        The position style property influences layout in a powerful way. By default
        it has a value of static, meaning the element sits in its normal place in the
        document. When it is set to the relative, the element still takes up space in
        the document, but now the top and left style properties can be used to move it
        relative to that normal place.
        When position is set to absolute, the element is removed from the normal document
        flow - that is, it no longer takes up space and may overlap with other elements.
        Also, its top and left properties can be used to absolutely position it relative
        to the top-left corner of the nearest enclosing element whose position property
        isn't static, or relative to the document if no such enclosing element exists.

        We can use this to create an animation. The following document displays a picture
        of a cat that moves around in an eclipse:
      */

      const cat = document.querySelector('img');
      let angle = Math.PI / 2;

      // Defines a function
      function animate(time, lastTime) {
        if (lastTime !== null) {
          angle += (time - lastTime) * 0.001;
        }
        // cat.style.top = Math.sin(angle) * 20 + 'px';
        // cat.style.left = Math.cos(angle) * 200 + 'px';
        cat.style.top = `${Math.sin(angle) * 20}px`;
        cat.style.left = `${Math.cos(angle) * 200}px`;
        requestAnimationFrame((newTime) => animate(newTime, time));
      }

      requestAnimationFrame(animate);
